# Timeout Configuration Test Validation

This file documents the timeout improvements made to fix the "Timed out 5000ms waiting" error.

## Original Issue
The Playwright tests were failing with:
```
Error: Timed out 5000ms waiting
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The default Playwright expect timeout is 5000ms, which is too short for:
1. CI environments which are typically slower
2. Next.js dev server startup 
3. Form submissions with loading states
4. Navigation transitions

## Timeout Improvements Made

### 1. Global Test Timeout
- **Before:** 30000ms (default)
- **After:** 60000ms (120000ms in CI)

### 2. Expect Timeout  
- **Before:** 5000ms (default)
- **After:** 15000ms (30000ms in CI)

### 3. Navigation Timeout
- **Before:** 30000ms (default) 
- **After:** 30000ms (60000ms in CI)

### 4. Action Timeout
- **Before:** No explicit setting
- **After:** 15000ms (30000ms in CI)

### 5. WebServer Timeout
- **Before:** No explicit setting
- **After:** 120000ms (300000ms in CI)

## Specific Test Updates

### Loading State Tests
Updated tests that check for brief loading states (like "Signing In...") to use shorter timeouts (3000ms) since these states may be very brief.

### Navigation Tests
Updated `waitForURL` calls from 10000ms to 30000ms for more reliable navigation waiting.

### Test Helpers
Increased wait times in helper functions for more robust test execution.

## CI Configuration
Added dynamic timeout configuration that automatically increases timeouts in CI environments by detecting the `CI` environment variable.

## Validation
The configuration has been validated by:
1. ✅ TypeScript compilation check
2. ✅ Next.js build process  
3. ✅ Playwright test listing
4. ✅ Configuration syntax validation

These changes should resolve the "Timed out 5000ms waiting" errors by providing more appropriate timeouts for different environments and scenarios.
